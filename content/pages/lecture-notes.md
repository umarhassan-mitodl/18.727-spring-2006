These notes are somewhat rough: they may contain some mistakes, so please use caution when reading them.

Some notes about Grassmannians. ({{% resource_link 724a313e-15ee-9f90-ae45-37c0c240f893 "PDF" %}})

Some notes about the construction of the Hilbert scheme. Included are some notes on G.I.T. and the construction of the moduli spaces. ({{% resource_link 06c4e979-c3da-dcba-7d0f-3dd69efdb315 "PDF" %}})

Some notes containing a brief survey of the cohomology of the moduli space of curves and the Harer-Zagier formula for the orbifold Euler characteristic. I added a few words outlining other work of Harer on the stability of the cohomology of the moduli space of curves. ({{% resource_link e804cb6c-61fb-bc1d-22dd-5926b54e8696 "PDF" %}})

Some notes describing the Picard group of the moduli space of curves. ({{% resource_link 10078cf3-d80a-1cdf-4ff7-66a80eee8b32 "PDF" %}})

Some notes about the Kodaira dimension of the moduli space of curves. ({{% resource_link 62affca2-8e90-7c4b-bfb6-655e172a04d6 "PDF" %}}) You should also read Chapter 5 and 6F of Harris, J., and I. Morrison. _Moduli of Curves_. New York, NY: Springer-Verlag, 1998, p. 366. ISBN: 0387984380. (U.S.)

Some notes on the Kontsevich moduli space of genus zero stable maps. ({{% resource_link da396726-34b1-1e4f-26bc-f4c45dbbd950 "PDF" %}})
