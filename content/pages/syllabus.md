A paper of 6-12 pages related to algebraic combinatorics is due on the last class. The paper should be printed in some flavor of TeX (e.g., LaTeX). It is strongly recommended that all figures be drawn with some graphics package (such as xfig) that can be incorporated into LaTeX, the reason being that knowing how to do this will prove invaluable for your future career.

The paper need not have any original mathematics, but it should consist of more than paraphrasing from a single source. There should be a bibliography with at least two references. You can choose any topic related to algebraic combinatorics, but your topic needs to be approved in advance. In particular, the paper must involve some algebra (linear algebra, groups, rings, fields, ...). Therefore please let me know (in person or by email) your proposed paper topic. Include a couple of sentences about what material you plan to cover.

Some suggestions for paper topics, along with ideas for sources:

My book _Combinatorics and Commutative Algebra_ has many possible topics, as does _Combinatorial Commutative Algebra_ by Miller and Sturmfels.

The article "Topological methods" by Anders Björner in _Handbook of Combinatorics_, vol. 2, pp. 1819-1872, is a good place to get started.

A huge topic. The book _Spectra of Graphs_, 3rd ed., by Cvetkovic, Doob, and Sachs will get you into the literature. The book _Algebraic Graph Theory_ by Biggs also has a lot of information.

Course Description
------------------

This course introduces techniques for studying intersection theory on moduli spaces such as homogeneous varieties, the Deligne-Mumford moduli space of stable curves and the Kontsevich moduli spaces of stable maps. The course emphasizes how one can deduce global geometric properties of moduli spaces and the objects they parameterize using intersection theory.

The topics include:

1.  Littlewood-Richardson rules for Grassmannians,
2.  Basic results about the divisor theory and cohomology of Mg due to Harer, Zagier, Arbarello and Cornalba,
3.  A study of Brill-Noether theory and the theory of limit linear series in order to prove that Mg is of general type if g is greater than or equal to 24,
4.  Recent developments due to Farkas, Gibney, Keel, Khosla and Morrison about the ample and effective cones of Mg,
5.  The Gromov-Witten invariants of simple homogeneous varieties, and
6.  The ample and effective cones of Kontsevich moduli spaces.

Prerequisites
-------------

Algebraic Geometry (18.725). This is a first year graduate class in algebraic geometry at the level of the second and third chapters of R. Hartshorne (_Algebraic geometry_. New York, NY: Springer-Verlag, 1977). Familiarity with algebraic topology helpful.

Required Text
-------------

There is no required text for this course. However, there are many {{% resource_link f5e3608f-6cd8-31f4-62c9-dece3b2820ef "recommended readings" %}}.

Grading
-------

Since there are no problem sets or exams for this course, the grade is based primarily on participation in the class.
